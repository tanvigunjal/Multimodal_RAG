# Multimodal RAG Project

This project is a sophisticated, production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application designed to answer queries based on a diverse range of documents. It leverages a powerful multimodal ingestion pipeline, a robust vector database, and state-of-the-art language models to provide accurate, context-aware responses.

## Features

- **Multimodal Data Ingestion:** Supports a wide variety of file formats, including PDF, images, and more, by leveraging the `unstructured` library.
- **Advanced RAG Pipeline:** Utilizes LangChain for orchestrating a complex RAG pipeline, including document chunking, embedding, and retrieval.
- **State-of-the-Art LLMs:** Integrates with Google's Generative AI models to provide high-quality, conversational answers.
- **High-Performance Vector Store:** Uses Qdrant as a scalable and efficient vector database for storing and retrieving document embeddings.
- **Web-Based UI:** A clean and intuitive frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for easy interaction with the RAG agent.
- **Containerized Deployment:** Fully containerized with Docker and Docker Compose for easy setup, portability, and scalability.
- **Production-Ready:** Includes health checks, environment-based configuration, and a scalable architecture.

## User Interface

The application features a clean and intuitive web interface that provides smooth interaction with the RAG system.

## Architecture Overview

The application is composed of three main services orchestrated by Docker Compose:

1.  **Frontend:** A static web interface served by Nginx that allows users to:
    - Upload and manage documents
    - Interactive chat interface
    - Real-time document processing status
    - Theme customization
    - User authentication

2.  **Backend:** A FastAPI application that provides:
    - REST API for document ingestion and querying
    - Core RAG logic implementation
    - Document processing and embedding generation
    - Authentication and session management
    - Health monitoring endpoints
    - Language model integration
    - Vectorization services

3.  **Qdrant:** Vector database service that provides:
    - Efficient vector storage and retrieval
    - Similarity search capabilities
    - Persistent storage
    - High-performance querying
    - Scalable architecture

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- A Google Generative AI API key

### Installation & Configuration

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Create an environment file:**
    Copy the example environment file and fill in the required values.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    You will need to add your `GOOGLE_API_KEY` to this file.

3.  **Build and run the application:**
    Use Docker Compose to build the images and start the services in detached mode.
    ```bash
    docker compose up --build -d
    ```

### Usage

1.  **Access the web interface:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8081`.

2.  **Upload documents:**
    Use the UI to upload the documents you want to query. The backend will process and ingest them into the vector database.

3.  **Ask questions:**
    Once the documents are ingested, you can start asking questions through the chat interface. The RAG agent will retrieve relevant information from the documents and generate a comprehensive answer.

### Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Backend Service Issues:**
   - Check logs: `docker compose logs backend`
   - Verify environment variables
   - Ensure Google API key is valid

2. **Vector Database Issues:**
   - Check Qdrant status: `curl http://localhost:6333/health`
   - Verify storage permissions
   - Check available disk space

3. **Frontend Issues:**
   - Clear browser cache
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify nginx configuration
